# Porter_Project


🔧 Project Description:
This project is a backend system for a logistics and goods transportation application, inspired by platforms like Porter. It allows customers to schedule deliveries from one location to another, track their delivery status, and manage requests securely using JWT-based authentication.

The system is built using Django and Django REST Framework, with MySQL as the backend database and a custom user model for phone number-based authentication. The application is designed to serve as a foundation for a full logistics app including drivers, admins, OTP login, and live tracking extensions.

🚀 Key Features:
✅ Custom User Authentication using phone numbers (no email/username)

🔐 JWT-based secure login and token refresh

📍 Create and track delivery requests

📦 Manage delivery details like pickup address, drop address, item description, and status

🗃️ MySQL database integration

🔄 Full CRUD API for managing deliveries

📁 Modular and scalable codebase for future driver/admin dashboards or mobile app integration
